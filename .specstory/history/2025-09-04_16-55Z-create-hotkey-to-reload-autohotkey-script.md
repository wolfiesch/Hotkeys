# Create hotkey to reload AutoHotkey script (2025-09-04 16:55Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 04:03Z)**_

is it possible to create a hotkey to reload the autohotkey script? it would save me a few clicks after each update

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely! You can create a hotkey to reload the AutoHotkey script. This is a very common and useful feature. Let me first check your current script to see what hotkeys you already have, then I'll show you how to add a reload hotkey.

Perfect! I can see your AutoHotkey script structure. Adding a reload hotkey is very straightforward. The most common approach is to use `Ctrl+Alt+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+R` to reload the script. Let me add this for you:

```ahk:ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk
; ... existing code ...

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Script Management
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Reload script hotkey - Ctrl+Alt+R
^!r::
{
    ShowHUD("Reloading script...", 1000)
    Reload()
}

; ... existing code ...
```

I'll add this right after your timing constants section and before the helper functions. Here's the complete addition:

```ahk:ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk
; ... existing code ...

; Timing constants for consistent delays
class Timing {
    static RIBBON_DELAY := 120    ; Initial Alt key press (recommended 100-200ms)
    static DIALOG_DELAY := 250    ; Dialog interactions (recommended 250-500ms)
    static FAST_DELAY := 40       ; Quick operations
    static SLOW_DELAY := 500      ; Slow operations
    static NAV_DELAY := 50        ; Subsequent ribbon navigation (30-75ms)
}

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Script Management
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Reload script hotkey - Ctrl+Alt+R
^!r::
{
    ShowHUD("Reloading script...", 1000)
    Reload()
}

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; State - No longer needed for held-down system
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ... existing code ...
```

This adds a `Ctrl+Alt+R` hotkey that will:
1. Show a brief "Reloading script..." message
2. Reload the entire AutoHotkey script

The `Reload()` function in AutoHotkey v2 will:
- Close the current script instance
- Restart it with the updated file
- Preserve any global variables that were set

**Alternative hotkey options** if you prefer something else:
- `^+r` (Ctrl+Shift+R) - but this might conflict with your RightBorder macro
- `^!+r` (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R) 
- `F5` - simple function key
- `^!f5` (Ctrl+Alt+F5) - more complex but less likely to conflict

The `Ctrl+Alt+R` combination is very commonly used for script reloading and shouldn't conflict with any of your existing Excel hotkeys. After you save the file, you can immediately test it by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+R`!

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the mapping.md file to reflect recent changes. Let me first read the current mapping.md file and then check what changes have been made to the AutoHotkey script.

I can see that the script management section with the reload hotkey hasn't been added yet. Based on our previous conversation, I need to update the mapping.md file to include the new reload hotkey that was discussed. Let me update the mapping.md file:

make capslock + ctrl + q set row height to 5 (if it doesn't already do this)

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying the handler**

I need to adjust the handler for SC03A & q to have conditional behavior: if Ctrl is pressed, I’ll call SetRowHeight(5); otherwise, I’ll maintain SetColumnWidth(0.5). Additionally, I’ll update the mapping.md to reflect this new modifier combination. There’s already a section for special combinations, so I’ll add CapsLock+Ctrl+Q for Set Row Height 5. I need to document these changes in the changelog and implement the code edits in ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk accordingly.
**Planning the task**

The instructions mention using a tool for medium-to-large tasks, and I’ll create a simple todo list with two items while making sure to preserve the indentation style. I need to check the AHK file to ensure it uses tabs for indentation, especially around the SC03A & q block. I'll inspect if the lines start with tabs and confirm this by looking at the read_file output. Since the code uses tabs without spaces, I'll keep that consistent. I’ll use functions.apply_patch to edit the file with the necessary context.
**Reviewing the content**

I think it's a good idea to review the section around SC03A & q again to understand the exact content. I’ll focus on reading lines 820-830 to gather the necessary details. This will help me ensure that I have the right context before proceeding with my tasks. It’s always better to be thorough!</details></think>

---

I'll add a CapsLock+Ctrl+Q combo that sets row height to 5 while preserving the existing CapsLock+Q behavior. Then I'll update `mapping.md` accordingly.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing a new hotkey**

I need to set up a new hotkey: CapsLock + Ctrl + Q to adjust the row height to 5. I noticed that the CapsLock layer uses SC03A as a modifier. The existing code checks if Ctrl is pressed with `GetKeyState("Ctrl","P")`. Currently, the CapsLock + Q hotkey adjusts the column width, but I need to modify it so that when Ctrl is held down, it sets the row height instead. I’ll follow the same pattern used for the other keys.
**Updating documentation and mapping**

I need to update mapping.md by adding an entry for CapsLock + Ctrl + Q under Special Modifier Combinations, specifying it sets the row height to 5pt. I’ll also mention that CapsLock + Q still sets the column width to 0.5, which is already documented. Additionally, I must update the changelog with the new entry and current date. It looks like previous changes were removed, so now, adding the Ctrl + Q mapping and editing the documentation is the priority. I’ll also update the Last Updated date.
**Updating changelog and tasks**

I should definitely update the changelog with today’s date, which is 2025-09-04. I’ll add a new entry to note the addition of CapsLock + Ctrl + Q for setting the row height to 5pt. I also need to confirm that modifications are tracked and ensure that the table of contents no longer includes the Script Management section since it's been removed. Following developer instructions, I’ll create a todo list for the small code and documentation changes, marking the first item as in progress.
**Modifying file with apply_patch**

I need to use apply_patch to modify a file. However, following the making_code_changes rule, I should first re-read the file if it hasn't been opened in the last five messages. I remember seeing about 820 lines earlier, so I want to focus on lines 823-829, especially around line 824, to ensure I have the right context. I’ll also verify the indentation style since it appears the file uses tabs. I'll need to preserve the same indentation as the surrounding lines when applying the changes.
**Implementing hotkey changes and documentation update**

I need to implement the hotkey block for CapsLock + Q. Right now, it's just a single line for setting the column width, but I’ll change it to a block that checks if Ctrl is held down. I want to keep the comment consistent, mentioning "CapsLock + Q or CapsLock + Ctrl + Q."

Next, I’ll update mapping.md by adding a new entry for CapsLock + Ctrl + Q under Special Modifier Combinations and ensure existing entries are unchanged. I’ll also create a changelog entry for today's date about this addition. Finally, I’ll read the relevant files for context and apply any necessary patches. Let's proceed!</details></think>

---

I'll add the CapsLock+Ctrl+Q hotkey in the script and update the docs accordingly. Then I'll mark these tasks as done.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Add CapsLock+Ctrl+Q to set row height to 5pt in ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk
- [ ] Update mapping.md: document CapsLock+Ctrl+Q and add changelog entry

---

I'll add the new hotkey logic near the existing CapsLock+Q mapping, handling Ctrl detection consistently with other combos. Then I'll update the docs.

## Todo List

- [x] Add CapsLock+Ctrl+Q to set row height to 5pt in ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk
- [x] Update mapping.md: document CapsLock+Ctrl+Q and add changelog entry

---

- I added `CapsLock+Ctrl+Q` to set row height to 5pt while keeping `CapsLock+Q` as Set Column Width 0.5. You can use it while holding CapsLock in Excel.
- I updated `mapping.md` to document `CapsLock+Ctrl+Q` under Sizing and Special Modifier Combinations, and added a changelog entry.

Key code edit in `ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk`:
```824:831:C:\Users\wschoenberger\Hotkeys\ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk
; DIVIDERS / SIZING
SC03A & q::                                                                            ; CapsLock+Q or CapsLock+Ctrl+Q
{
    if GetKeyState("Ctrl","P") {
        Do(() => SetRowHeight(5), "Set Row Height 5pt")
    } else {
        Do(() => SetColumnWidth(0.5), "Set Column Width")
    }
}
```

Docs updated in `mapping.md`:
- Added to Sizing: `CapsLock+Ctrl+Q` → Set Row Height 5pt
- Added to Special Modifier Combinations
- Changelog: “Added CapsLock+Ctrl+Q…”
