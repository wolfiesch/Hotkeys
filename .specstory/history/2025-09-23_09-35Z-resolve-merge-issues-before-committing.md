I need to commit to GitHub and fix merge issues, which means I'll be running terminal git commands. I'll rely on the functions.run_terminal_cmd tool for this. It’s a multi-step task that includes checking repo status, pulling the latest changes, resolving conflicts, committing, and finally pushing changes. I’ll be working in the user's specified workspace path and will use commands like `git status`, `git fetch`, and `git pull --rebase` to troubleshoot issues. If conflicts arise, I’ll edit files as needed. Time to get started!

The instructions suggest that I should default to parallel execution for multiple read-only commands. However, since git commands can depend on one another, I should start with running `git status -sb`, `git remote -v`, and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` in parallel since they’re independent. After that, I can fetch the latest remote changes. I need to prepare to handle any merge issues and stage</details></think>
