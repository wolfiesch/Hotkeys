- **Microsoft Excel**: Any version 2016 or later
- **Git**: For version control
- **Text Editor**: VS Code, Notepad++, or any editor with AutoHotkey syntax support

### Testing Environment

1. **Create a test Excel file** with sample data
2. **Test each hotkey** systematically
3. **Verify ribbon commands** work as expected
4. **Check for conflicts** with other applications

### Code Organization

The main script (`ExcelDatabookLayers.ahk`) is organized into sections:
- **PowerPoint hotkeys** (lines ~1-50)
- **Excel CapsLock layer** (lines ~51-200)
- **Helper functions** (lines ~201+)

When adding new hotkeys:
- Place them in the appropriate section
- Follow the existing pattern
- Add comments explaining the functionality
